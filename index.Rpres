Data Sets in R of Interest
========================================================
transition: rotate

* LakeHuron: Annual measurements of the level, in feet, of Lake Huron 1875â€“1972
* sunspot.year: Yearly numbers of sunspots from 1700 to 1988 (rounded to one digit).
* co2: Mauna Loa Atmospheric CO2 Concentration
* nhtemp: Average Yearly Temperatures in New Haven
* treering: Yearly Treering Data, -6000-1979

Plot showing LakeHuron Time Series
========================================================
```{r,echo=FALSE}
dsname <- "LakeHuron"
ds1=get(dsname)
df1=data.frame(t=time(ds1),y=ds1)
fit1=lm(y~t,df1)
      
# Plot data
f.slope=round(fit1$coefficients[2],2)
f.mean=round(mean(ds1))
maintitle=paste(dsname,", mean=",f.mean,", slope=",f.slope)
plot(ds1,ylab=dsname,main=maintitle)

# Plot mean
abline(h=mean(ds1),col="red")

# Plot linear trend line
abline(fit1,col="blue")
```

Interesting Tool Features
========================================================
* Plot a single time series
* Plot two time series above each other, with common time window if desired
* Cross-plot one time series against another and report $R^2$ value for a linear regression
