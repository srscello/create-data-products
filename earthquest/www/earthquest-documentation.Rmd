# Overview
* EarthQuest enables exploration of time series data sets found in the base R package.
* Data sets can be plotted alone or in comparison plots.
* The time range can be adjusted to the common time range of the two data sets.
* Data sets can be plotted against each other and a linear model will be fit to explore any correlation via $R^2$


# Available Data Sets
* LakeHuron: Annual measurements of the level, in feet, of Lake Huron 1875â€“1972
* sunspot.year: Yearly numbers of sunspots from 1700 to 1988 (rounded to one digit).
* co2: Mauna Loa Atmospheric CO2 Concentration
* nhtemp: Average Yearly Temperatures in New Haven
* treering: Yearly Treering Data, -6000-1979

# How to Use EarthQuest
## Plot a single time series and report its mean and slope
1) Select a single time series using the selection input

## Plot two time series above each other
1) Check the box to  Compare Datasets
1) Select a second time series
1) Check the box to Trim the Time Range to a common range for both sets if desired.
1) Select other data sets to compare if desired

## Plot one time series versus another, and report the $R^2$ value for a linear model
1) Check the box to  Compare Datasets
1) Select a second time series
1) Check the crossplot select box
1) Select other data sets to compare if desired
